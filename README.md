## Tic-Tac-Toe!

The game Tic-Tac-Toe has entertained people going as far back as ancient Egypt to the medieval cathedrals of England. 

This game consists of a three by three grid in which two players must place their designated piece into the empty spaces of the board.

The goal of the game is to get three pieces in a row, vertically, horisontally, or diaganolly.

The player to do this first is the winner!

I went with a clean and minimalistic user experience.

When loading the game, it will first look like the following:

Once the player with the 'X' piece clicks on a box, the user will see the number of pieces they have left as well as who's turn it is next:

As both players continue to place their pieces, the first player to get three in a row will stop the game and display that winner of that game.

If X is the winner:

If O is the winner:

If there is a tie:

If the players would like to play the game again, their is a reset button which will reset the board and allow the players to be entertained for as along as they want.
